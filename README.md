Things I would have liked to have added:
	- Locally scoped variables seperate to the stylesheets classes
	- Fixed styling to be closer
	- Moved to ternary for render checks
	- Snapshot tests for component renders
	- Unit tests for sortGroup method
	- Stripped out moments locales
	- Finished the popupModal
	- Added hover effects
	- Dug deeper into package.json for unused modules
	- Added storybook versions of components
